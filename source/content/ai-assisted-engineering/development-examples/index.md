> **Planted**: August 25, 2025 | **Last Tended**: August 25, 2025

*Real-world project examples implementing AI-assisted development with cost optimization strategies*

This collection demonstrates how to apply the principles from the [Cline Cost Optimization Guide](../cline-cost-optimization-guide/index.md) across different types of development projects that align with my actual expertise and background. Each example includes complete project setup, configuration files, and workflow strategies.

## 🌱 Project Examples

### Embedded Linux Camera System
- **[Embedded Camera Project Example](embedded-camera-example/index.md)** - V4L2 driver development with MIPI CSI integration
  - Video4Linux driver debugging and optimization
  - Device tree configuration and kernel module development
  - Memory-constrained environment considerations
  - Integration with existing [Video4Linux journey](Digital%20Garden/embedded-systems/video4linux-mipi-journey/index.md)

### GStreamer Pipeline Development
- **[GStreamer Pipeline Example](gstreamer-pipeline-example/index.md)** - Real-time video processing pipeline optimization
  - Multi-format pipeline architecture (Y12, multiplanar formats)
  - Performance optimization for embedded platforms
  - WebRTC streaming integration
  - Building on [GStreamer journey](../../multimedia/gstreamer/) experiences

### Knowledge Management Automation
- **[Knowledge System Example](knowledge-automation-example/index.md)** - Automated documentation and knowledge capture
  - Obsidian plugin development and automation
  - Markdown processing and cross-referencing
  - Template generation and content organization
  - Integration with existing [knowledge management](../../tools-and-utilities/obsidian-knowledge-management/) workflows

## 🎯 Common Patterns Across Examples

### Project Setup Strategy
Each example demonstrates:
- **Domain-specific `.clineignore`** configurations for embedded/multimedia projects
- **Custom `.clinerules`** tailored to hardware-software integration contexts
- **Model selection** strategies based on technical complexity and debugging needs
- **Context management** techniques for large codebases with hardware dependencies

### Cost Optimization Implementation
- **Strategic model switching** during different development phases (exploration vs. implementation)
- **Targeted prompting** techniques for specific technologies (V4L2, GStreamer, kernel development)
- **Workflow optimization** to minimize expensive debugging iterations
- **Documentation generation** strategies for technical knowledge capture

### Quality Assurance Integration
- **AI-assisted code review** for embedded C and multimedia code
- **Hardware-in-the-loop testing** with AI-generated test scenarios
- **Performance profiling** and optimization with AI assistance
- **Knowledge documentation** that stays current and useful

## 🔗 Connected Knowledge

### Integration with Existing Expertise
- **[Embedded Systems](../../embedded-systems/)** - Direct application in camera systems and containerization
- **[Multimedia](../../multimedia/)** - GStreamer pipeline development and optimization
- **[Tools & Utilities](../../tools-and-utilities/)** - Knowledge management and workflow automation
- **[Development Practices](../../development-practices/)** - Code review and project management enhancement

### Cross-Project Learning
- **Shared configurations** for embedded Linux development environments
- **Reusable prompting patterns** for hardware debugging and multimedia optimization
- **Cost monitoring techniques** for long-running development and testing cycles
- **Documentation strategies** that capture both process and results

## 📊 Expected Outcomes
