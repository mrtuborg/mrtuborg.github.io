# Welcome 🌿

This is my personal knowledge garden where ideas grow, evolve, and interconnect over time. Unlike a traditional blog, this space embraces the messy, iterative process of learning and building knowledge.

## How to Navigate This Garden
**[Learn more about digital gardening](What%20is%20Digital%20Gardening.md)**

**🌱 Seedlings** - Early ideas, rough notes, experiments  
**🌿 Budding** - Developing concepts, work in progress  
**🌳 Evergreen** - Mature thoughts (still growing!)

**If you're finding articles that seem "incomplete" or "work in progress" - that's intentional!**

Everything here is a living document, continuously tended and evolved. Feel free to explore any path that interests you - the garden is designed for wandering, not just reading.

This garden grows through:
- **Continuous cultivation** - Regular updates and refinements
- **Learning in public** - Sharing the process, not just results
- **Contextual exploration** - Multiple pathways through the knowledge
- **Cross-pollination** - Insights from one domain enriching others
