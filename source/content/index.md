# Welcome to My Digital Garden 🌿

This is my personal knowledge garden where ideas grow, evolve, and interconnect over time. Unlike a traditional blog, this space embraces the messy, iterative process of learning and building knowledge.

## 🌱 What is Digital Gardening?

**If you're finding articles that seem "incomplete" or "work in progress" - that's intentional!**

Digital gardening is a different approach to sharing knowledge that prioritizes **learning in public** over polished final products. Here's what makes this space different:

### 🔄 Living Documents vs Static Articles
- **Traditional blogs**: Publish once, rarely update
- **Digital gardens**: Continuously evolve, improve, and grow over time
- **Why this matters**: You get to see knowledge develop, including the messy parts that lead to breakthroughs

### 🕸️ Interconnected vs Linear
- **Traditional blogs**: Read one article, then leave
- **Digital gardens**: Ideas link to each other, creating knowledge networks
- **Why this matters**: You discover unexpected connections between topics (like how ToF camera memory management relates to C code optimization)

### 🎯 Atomic vs Monolithic
- **Traditional blogs**: Long, comprehensive articles that try to cover everything
- **Digital gardens**: Short, focused notes that can be combined in different ways
- **Why this matters**: You can quickly find and implement specific techniques without reading entire guides

### 📈 Process vs Product
- **Traditional blogs**: Show only final results
- **Digital gardens**: Show the learning journey, including failures and iterations
- **Why this matters**: You learn not just what works, but how to think through problems

## How to Navigate This Garden

**🌱 Seedlings** - Early ideas, rough notes, experiments  
**🌿 Budding** - Developing concepts, work in progress  
**🌳 Evergreen** - Mature thoughts (still growing!)

### 🧭 Navigation Tips
- **Follow your curiosity** - Click on links that interest you, even if they seem unrelated
- **Expect work-in-progress** - Incomplete notes often contain the most valuable insights
- **Look for connections** - Notice how embedded systems concepts relate to AI optimization
- **Return often** - Notes evolve, so revisiting can reveal new insights

### 🔍 What You'll Find Here
- **Technical deep-dives** broken into digestible, actionable pieces
- **Real-world problem-solving** with all the messy details included
- **Cross-domain insights** where hardware knowledge informs software practices
- **Learning journeys** showing how understanding develops over time

Everything here is a living document, continuously tended and evolved. Feel free to explore any path that interests you - the garden is designed for wandering, not just reading.
