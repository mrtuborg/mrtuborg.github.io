# Welcome to My Digital Garden 🌿

This is my personal knowledge garden where ideas grow, evolve, and interconnect over time. Unlike a traditional blog, this space embraces the messy, iterative process of learning and building knowledge.

## How to Navigate This Garden

**🌱 Seedlings** - Early ideas, rough notes, experiments  
**🌿 Budding** - Developing concepts, work in progress  
**🌳 Evergreen** - Mature thoughts (still growing!)

Everything here is a living document, continuously tended and evolved. Feel free to explore any path that interests you.
