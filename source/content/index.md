# Welcome to My Digital Garden 🌿

This is my personal knowledge garden where ideas grow, evolve, and interconnect over time. Unlike a traditional blog, this space embraces the messy, iterative process of learning and building knowledge.

## 🌱 What is Digital Gardening?

**If you're finding articles that seem "incomplete" or "work in progress" - that's intentional!**

This is a digital garden, not a traditional blog. Content here evolves over time, connects across topics, and prioritizes **learning in public** over polished final products. → **[Learn more about digital gardening](What%20is%20Digital%20Gardening.md)**

## How to Navigate This Garden

**🌱 Seedlings** - Early ideas, rough notes, experiments  
**🌿 Budding** - Developing concepts, work in progress  
**🌳 Evergreen** - Mature thoughts (still growing!)

Everything here is a living document, continuously tended and evolved. Feel free to explore any path that interests you - the garden is designed for wandering, not just reading.
