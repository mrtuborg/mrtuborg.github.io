# 4. Advanced V4L Features

Beyond basic operations, the Video4Linux (V4L) subsystem offers advanced capabilities that allow developers to build custom applications and optimize video handling on embedded devices. This chapter covers the V4L2 API, video format negotiation, buffer management, and handling multiple video inputs.

## 4.1 Using V4L2 API for Custom Applications

The V4L2 API provides a comprehensive programming interface for interacting with video devices at a low level. Developers can use it to:

- Query device capabilities  
- Configure video formats and frame sizes  
- Manage buffers for efficient video streaming  
- Control device parameters programmatically  

The API is accessible through system calls and is documented in the Linux kernel documentation. Libraries such as `libv4l` simplify working with the API in user-space applications.

## 4.2 Video Format and Frame Size Negotiation

Video devices support multiple pixel formats and frame sizes. Applications must negotiate these parameters with the device to ensure compatibility.

Using `v4l2-ctl`, you can list supported formats:

```
v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --list-formats-ext
```

To set a specific format and frame size:

```
v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --set-fmt-video=width=640,height=480,pixelformat=YUYV
```

Proper negotiation ensures optimal performance and compatibility with downstream processing.

## 4.3 Buffer Management and Memory Mapping

Efficient video streaming requires managing buffers between the kernel and user space. V4L2 supports several I/O methods:

- **Read/Write:** Simple but less efficient for high-throughput streaming  
- **Memory Mapping (mmap):** Maps device buffers into user space for zero-copy access  
- **User Pointer:** Allows applications to allocate buffers  

Memory mapping is commonly used in embedded systems for performance. Applications must request buffers, queue them for capture, and dequeue them after processing.

## 4.4 Handling Multiple Video Inputs

Some devices support multiple video inputs or streams. The V4L2 API and media controller framework allow selecting and configuring these inputs.

To list available inputs:

```
v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --list-inputs
```

To select an input:

```
v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --set-input=1
```

Managing multiple inputs enables complex video pipelines and switching between sources.
