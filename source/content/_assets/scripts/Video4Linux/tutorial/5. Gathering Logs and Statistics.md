# 5. Gathering Logs and Statistics

Effective troubleshooting and performance monitoring of the Video4Linux (V4L) subsystem require gathering logs and statistics. This chapter explains how to enable debug logging, use diagnostic tools, and monitor device performance.

## 5.1 Enabling Debug Logs for V4L Drivers

Most V4L kernel drivers support debug logging that can provide detailed information about device operations and errors. To enable debug logs:

- Use kernel parameters or debugfs interfaces specific to your driver.  
- Increase the kernel log verbosity level with:

```
dmesg -n 8
```

- Check the kernel log for V4L-related messages:

```
dmesg | grep video
```

Refer to your device driver documentation for driver-specific debug options.

## 5.2 Using v4l2-ctl for Diagnostics

The `v4l2-ctl` utility offers several commands to gather device status and statistics:

- List device capabilities:

```
v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --all
```

- Query current control values:

```
v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --get-ctrl=brightness
```

- Monitor streaming statistics (if supported):

```
v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --stream-stats
```

These commands help verify device configuration and operational status.

## 5.3 Monitoring Device Performance and Statistics

For ongoing monitoring, you can use system tools and scripts to track:

- Frame rates and dropped frames  
- Buffer queue status  
- CPU and memory usage related to video processing  

Some drivers expose statistics via sysfs or debugfs entries, which can be read periodically.

Example to check buffer status:

```
cat /sys/class/video4linux/video0/buffer_status
```

Combining these logs and statistics enables comprehensive diagnostics and performance tuning.
