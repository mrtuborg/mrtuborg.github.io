# 3. Basic V4L Operations

Once your embedded device is set up with the Video4Linux (V4L) subsystem, you can start performing basic operations to interact with video devices. This chapter covers common tasks such as listing devices, capturing video frames, streaming video data, and controlling device parameters.

## 3.1 Listing Video Devices

To identify available video devices on your system, use the `v4l2-ctl` utility:

```
v4l2-ctl --list-devices
```

This command displays all detected video devices along with their associated device nodes (e.g., `/dev/video0`). Knowing the device node is essential for further operations.

## 3.2 Capturing Video Frames

You can capture single frames or video streams using tools like `v4l2-ctl` or custom applications.

To capture a single frame and save it as a JPEG image:

```
v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --stream-mmap --stream-count=1 --stream-to=frame.jpg
```

Replace `/dev/video0` with your device node. This command uses memory-mapped buffers to capture one frame.

## 3.3 Streaming Video Data

For continuous video streaming, you can use `v4l2-ctl` or other applications like `ffmpeg` or `gstreamer`.

Example using `v4l2-ctl` to start streaming:

```
v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --stream-mmap --stream-count=100
```

This captures 100 frames from the device.

Alternatively, you can use `ffmpeg` to display or record video streams:

```
ffmpeg -f v4l2 -i /dev/video0 output.mkv
```

## 3.4 Controlling Device Parameters (Brightness, Contrast, etc.)

V4L devices support various controls to adjust image properties. To list available controls:

```
v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --list-ctrls
```

To set a control value, for example, brightness:

```
v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --set-ctrl=brightness=128
```

Adjust the value according to your deviceâ€™s supported range.
