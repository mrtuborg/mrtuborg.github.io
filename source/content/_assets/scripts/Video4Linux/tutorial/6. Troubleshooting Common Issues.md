# 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

While working with the Video4Linux (V4L) subsystem on embedded devices, you may encounter various issues. This chapter covers common problems and practical solutions to help you diagnose and resolve them efficiently.

## 6.1 Device Not Detected

If your video device does not appear in the system:

- Verify hardware connections and power supply.  
- Check kernel modules are loaded:

```
lsmod | grep video
```

- Confirm device nodes exist under `/dev` (e.g., `/dev/video0`).  
- Review kernel logs for errors:

```
dmesg | grep video
```

- Ensure kernel configuration includes support for your device.

## 6.2 Permission and Access Problems

Access to video devices may be restricted by permissions:

- Check device node permissions:

```
ls -l /dev/video0
```

- Add your user to the appropriate group (commonly `video`):

```
sudo usermod -aG video <username>
```

- Log out and back in for group changes to take effect.

## 6.3 Video Capture Failures

If video capture fails or produces corrupted frames:

- Verify correct device node and input selection.  
- Check video format and frame size compatibility:

```
v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --list-formats-ext
```

- Adjust controls like brightness or exposure that may affect capture.  
- Test with different applications (e.g., `ffmpeg`, `mplayer`) to isolate the issue.

## 6.4 Kernel Module Conflicts

Conflicts between kernel modules can cause instability:

- Identify conflicting modules with `lsmod`.  
- Blacklist unnecessary or conflicting modules in `/etc/modprobe.d/`.  
- Rebuild kernel or modules if needed to resolve conflicts.
