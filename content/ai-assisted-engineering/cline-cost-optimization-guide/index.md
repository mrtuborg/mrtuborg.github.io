## üí∞ Model Selection Strategy

### Budget Models (Recommended)
| Model | Input Price* | Output Price* | Best For |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **DeepSeek V3** | $0.14 | $0.28 | Daily coding (cheapest) |
| **DeepSeek R1** | $0.55 | $2.19 | Budget reasoning |
| **Qwen3 Coder** | $0.20 | $0.80 | Coding tasks |
| **Z AI GLM 4.5** | TBD | TBD | MIT licensed |

*Per million tokens

### Premium Models (Use Strategically)
| Model | Input Price* | Output Price* | Best For |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Claude Sonnet 4** | $3-6 | $15-22.50 | Complex reasoning |
| **GPT-5** | $1.25 | $10 | Latest OpenAI tech |
| **Gemini 2.5 Pro** | TBD | TBD | Large codebases |

### Strategic Model Switching
```
1. Start with DeepSeek V3 for exploration
2. Switch to Claude Sonnet 4 for complex reasoning
3. Switch back to DeepSeek V3 for implementation
4. Result: 80% cost savings vs. using premium throughout
```

## üìÅ Essential Project Setup

### 1. Create `.clineignore` File
```gitignore
# Dependencies
node_modules/
**/node_modules/
.pnp
.pnp.js

# Build outputs
/build/
/dist/
/.next/
/out/

# Testing
/coverage/

# Environment variables
.env*

# Large data files
*.csv
*.xlsx
*.log

# Documentation (unless needed)
docs/
*.md
README*
```

### 2. Create `.clinerules` File
```
# Cost Optimization Rules
- Be concise in all responses
- Don't create documentation files unless requested
- Focus on code implementation only
- Ask before creating new files
- Use existing file structure
- Minimize explanatory text
- No automatic README updates
```

### 3. Custom Instructions Setup
Go to Cline Settings (‚öôÔ∏è) and add:
```
COST OPTIMIZATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Be concise and direct in all responses
- Don't create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- Focus on code implementation over explanations
- Only create files that are essential to the task
- Ask before creating any new files beyond what's requested
- Use existing project structure
- Minimize token usage while maintaining quality
```

## üéØ Daily Workflow Optimization

### Plan & Act Mode Strategy
1. **Plan Mode**: Use for complex tasks to avoid expensive trial-and-error
2. **Act Mode**: Execute only after planning is complete
3. **Cost Benefit**: Prevents costly iterations and mistakes

### Strategic Prompting Techniques

#### Anti-Verbosity Prompts:
```
"Do not create any documentation files unless I specifically ask"
"Focus only on the code changes requested"
"Be concise and direct"
"Implementation only, no explanatory files"
"DO NOT BE LAZY. DO NOT OMIT CODE."
```

#### Scope Limiting:
```
"Only modify the specific file I mentioned"
"Don't create supporting files unless essential"
"Complete this task using only existing files"
"Update existing code, don't create documentation"
```

#### Confidence Checks:
```
"Rate your confidence (1-10) before any major changes"
"List all assumptions before proceeding"
"Ask 'stupid' questions to challenge assumptions"
```

### Context Management Tips
- Use `@filename` or `@foldername` for precise targeting
- Create checkpoints before major changes
- Use New Task tool when switching to unrelated work
- Monitor token usage in status bar

---

## üîß Advanced Cost-Saving Features

### Focus Chain
- Automatic todo list management
- Keeps Cline on track across long projects
- Prevents wandering off-task
- **Enable**: Automatically active in supported models

### Checkpoints
- Save conversation state at key points
- Roll back instead of starting over
- **Usage**: Create before experiments or major changes

### Auto-Compact (Premium Models Only)
- Automatically summarizes long conversations
- Uses prompt caching for cost efficiency
- **Available**: Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, GPT-5, Grok 4

### Drag & Drop
- Provide files directly to skip exploration
- Immediate context without discovery overhead
- **Usage**: Drag files into chat instead of asking Cline to find them

---

## üìä Feature Combinations for Maximum Savings

### The "Budget Optimization" Stack:
```
1. .clineignore (50-80% context reduction)
2. .clinerules (consistent concise behavior)
3. DeepSeek V3 model (95% cost reduction)
4. Strategic model switching (80% savings)
5. @ mentions (40-60% more targeted)
6. Plan & Act mode (30-50% fewer iterations)

Total Potential Savings: 70-90%
```

### The "Efficiency Workflow":
```
1. Start in Plan Mode for complex tasks
2. Use @ mentions for precise targeting
3. Enable Focus Chain for task tracking
4. Create checkpoints before major changes
5. Use New Task tool when switching contexts
6. Drag & drop files for immediate context
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Expensive Mistakes to Avoid

### Don't Do This:
- ‚ùå Using premium models for simple tasks
- ‚ùå Letting Cline create unnecessary documentation
- ‚ùå Starting new conversations instead of using New Task
- ‚ùå Broad exploration instead of targeted @ mentions
- ‚ùå Verbose prompts that encourage long responses
- ‚ùå Including large files in context unnecessarily

### Do This Instead:
- ‚úÖ Use budget models for routine work
- ‚úÖ Explicitly prevent documentation creation
- ‚úÖ Use New Task tool for context switching
- ‚úÖ Target specific files with @ mentions
- ‚úÖ Use concise, direct prompts
- ‚úÖ Leverage .clineignore to exclude irrelevant files

## üë• Team Implementation Guide

### Onboarding New Team Members
1. **Setup Checklist**:
   - Install Cline extension
   - Configure DeepSeek V3 as default model
   - Set up custom instructions
   - Create project .clineignore and .clinerules

2. **Training Session** (30 minutes):
   - Model switching demonstration
   - Prompting best practices
   - Feature overview (Plan & Act, @ mentions, etc.)
   - Cost monitoring techniques

### Standardizing Team Practices
1. **Shared Configuration**:
   - Standard .clineignore templates
   - Common .clinerules files
   - Approved model list with use cases
   - Custom instruction templates

2. **Team Guidelines**:
   - When to use which models
   - Prompting standards
   - Code review for Cline-generated content
   - Cost monitoring and reporting

### Measuring Success
- **Track Monthly Costs**: Compare before/after implementation
- **Monitor Token Usage**: Use built-in token counter
- **Measure Productivity**: Tasks completed per dollar spent
- **Team Feedback**: Regular check-ins on workflow efficiency

## üîç Troubleshooting & Quick Fixes

### High Costs? Check These:
1. **Model Selection**: Are you using budget models for routine tasks?
2. **Context Size**: Is .clineignore properly configured?
3. **Verbosity**: Are you getting unnecessary documentation?
4. **Task Scope**: Are you breaking down complex tasks?

### Performance Issues:
1. **Slow Responses**: Switch to faster models (Qwen3 on Cerebras)
2. **Poor Quality**: Use model switching for complex parts
3. **Context Limits**: Implement Auto-Compact or use New Task

### Quick Cost Recovery:
```
1. Immediately switch to DeepSeek V3
2. Add "be concise" to every prompt
3. Create .clineignore file
4. Use @ mentions instead of broad exploration
5. Enable Plan & Act mode for complex tasks
```
